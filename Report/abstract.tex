\chapter*{Abstract}
Medical imaging is a crucial component of medical diagnosis and treatment process. Due to limitations of imaging technology and varying imaging conditions, many medical images have low spatial resolution. This low resolution of medical images makes it difficult to detect minor anatomical features and abnormalities. Super Resolution (SR) is a class of software based techniques that are used to enhance the resolution of an image. Enhanced-resolution endoscopy has shown to improve adenoma detection rate for conventional endoscopy and is likely to do the same for capsule endoscopy.
\newline
In this work, we have done an extensive literature review of already existing state-of-art models for image super resolution (SRGAN \cite{SRGAN}, DenseNet \cite{DenseNET}, RCAN\cite{RCAN} etc.) In addition, we have developed a model architecture Densenet with Channel Attention Block(DCAN) which is able outperform existing state of art models in terms of perceptual quality as well as providing better values for the different image quality assessment metrices such as PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. We aslo performed statistical analysis on the predicted images to ensure the consistency of the model.
